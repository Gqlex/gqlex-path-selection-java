=======================
Great to have you here. Whether it's improving documentation, adding a new component, or suggesting an issue that will help us improve, all contributions are welcome!

## Contribution Expectations

#### Adding Functionality or Reporting Bugs
* You can look through the existing features/bugs in the project and contribute.
* You can report bugs as Jira issues. Give as much detail as possible. (Logs, stacktraces, versions, etc.)

#### Code Quality Expectations
- Tests: All new Java methods should have correlated JUnit tests
- Coverage: Ensure that code coverage **does not fall below 80%**
- Documentation: Code should be well-documented. What code is doing should be self-explanatory based on coding conventions. Why code is doing something should be explained:
	* Java code should have JavaDoc
	* `pom.xml` should have comments
	* Unit tests should have comments and failure messages
	* Integration tests should have comments and failure messages
- Code Style: We try to follow [Google's Coding Standards](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). It's easiest to format based on existing code you see. We don't enforce this; it's just a guideline

#### SLAs
The team that owns this repo is expected to practice the following:

>The pull request review SLA is 24 hours
- Address any incoming PRs for contributions
- Prioritize feature requests if handled by the team itself
- Support the contributor through code guidance and contribution recognition



## Contribution Process
**All contributions should be done through a fork**

1. Fork and Clone. From the GitHub UI, fork the project into your user space or another organization. Follow these steps, clone locally and add the upstream remote.
	```text
	$ git clone git@github.intuit.com:ORG/REPOSITORY.git
	$ cd <project>

	## If you have SSH keys set up, then add the SSH URL as an upstream.
	$ git remote add upstream git@github.intuit.com/ORG/REPOSITORY.git

	## If you want to type in your password when fetching from upstream, then add the HTTPS URL as an upstream.
	$ git remote add upstream https://github.intuit.com/ORG/REPOSITORY.git
	```
1. Create a branch (use the Jira project and prefix with "feature/" or "bugfix/").
	```text
	git checkout -b feature/JIRA-1234
	```
1. Make your changes, including documentation. Writing good commit logs is important. Follow the [Local Development](./README.md#getting-started-with-local-development) steps to get started.
	```text
	A commit log should describe what changed and why. 
	Make sure that the commit message contains the JIRA ticket associated with the change. 
	```
1. Test. Bug fixes and features **should come with tests** and coverage should meet or exceed 80%. Make sure all tests pass. Please do not submit patches that fail this check.

1. Push your changes to your fork's branch. Use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to sync your work from time to time.

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream 
   git rebase upstream/master
   git push origin name-of-your-branch
   ```

1. In GitHub, create a Pull Request to the upstream repository. On your forked repo, click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form.  
1. Making a PR will automatically trigger a series of checks against your changes.
1. The team will reach out if they need more information or to make suggestions.

## After Contribution is Merged

Once the PR is good to go, the team will merge it, and you'll be credited as a contributor! Reach out to the team to follow their release cycle. These key questions can help you know what to expect:

>- Are there ownership expectations in preprod/prod for a period of time?
>- When can a contributor expect to see merged code built and deployed to preprod and prod?
>- How can a contributor validate their code changes after changes have been deployed?


## Contact Information

* Need to get in contact with the team? The best people to start with are the project [code owners](./.github/CODEOWNERS).
