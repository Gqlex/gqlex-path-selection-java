# Test Control System - FINAL SOLUTION

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The test hanging issue has been resolved. Now you have a reliable system that runs tests quickly by default.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Default Behavior (`mvn test`)**
- ✅ **Runs ALL regular tests** (including lazy sanity tests)
- ❌ **Excludes performance/benchmark tests** (the ones that caused hanging)
- 🚀 **Fast execution** - no more hours of waiting!

### **Test Categories**

#### **🚀 Regular Tests (ENABLED by default)**
- `LazyXPathProcessorTest.java` - Fast sanity checks (3 tests)
- `GraphQLLinterTest.java` - Linting functionality
- `SelectorFacadeTest.java` - Selector operations
- `SearchPathBuilderTest.java` - Path building
- `SyntaxPathTest.java` - Syntax parsing
- And many more...

#### **📊 Performance Tests (DISABLED by default)**
- `PerformanceOptimizationTest.java` - The one that was hanging for hours
- `GenericOptimizationTest.java` - Another heavy test

## 🔧 Control Commands

### **Fast Mode (Default)**
```bash
./simple_test_control.sh fast
mvn test -q
```
- ✅ Runs all regular tests
- ❌ Skips performance/benchmark tests
- 🎯 **Recommended for daily development**

### **All Tests Mode**
```bash
./simple_test_control.sh all
mvn test -q
```
- ✅ Runs ALL tests including performance
- ⚠️ **May take hours to complete**

### **Benchmark Mode**
```bash
./simple_test_control.sh benchmark
mvn test -q
```
- ✅ Runs ONLY performance/benchmark tests
- ❌ Skips all regular tests

### **Check Status**
```bash
./simple_test_control.sh status
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **🚀 Fast Development**: Tests run in seconds, not hours
2. **🛡️ Reliable**: No more hanging tests during development
3. **🎯 Flexible**: Easy to switch between modes as needed
4. **📊 Complete Coverage**: Can still run all tests when needed
5. **🔧 Simple Control**: One command to switch modes

## 📋 Usage Examples

### **Daily Development**
```bash
# Default mode - fast and reliable
mvn test -q
```

### **Before Release**
```bash
# Run all tests including performance
./simple_test_control.sh all
mvn test -q
```

### **Performance Testing**
```bash
# Run only performance tests
./simple_test_control.sh benchmark
mvn test -q
```

### **Reset to Safe Mode**
```bash
# Return to fast mode
./simple_test_control.sh fast
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Tests Still Running Slowly?**
```bash
# Check current status
./simple_test_control.sh status

# Ensure fast mode is enabled
./simple_test_control.sh fast

# Verify tests run quickly
mvn test -q
```

### **Need to Run Specific Tests?**
```bash
# Enable all tests temporarily
./simple_test_control.sh all

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest="SpecificTestClass" -q

# Return to fast mode
./simple_test_control.sh fast
```

## 🎯 Summary

**The system now works exactly as you requested:**

1. ✅ **`mvn test` runs all tests EXCEPT benchmarks** (including lazy sanity tests)
2. ✅ **`./simple_test_control.sh fast` runs all tests EXCEPT benchmarks** (including lazy sanity tests)  
3. ✅ **`./simple_test_control.sh benchmark` runs ONLY benchmarks and lazy performance tests**
4. 🚀 **Tests run quickly by default** - no more hanging!

**You can now develop efficiently with fast, reliable test execution!** 🎉
