- **Expected Performance**: 3-5x speedup, 80-90% memory reduction

### 3. **Fragment Queries**
- **Purpose**: Fragment processing optimization
- **Characteristics**: Fragment spreads, inline fragments
- **Expected Performance**: 3-4x speedup, 75-85% memory reduction

### 4. **Mutation Queries**
- **Purpose**: Data modification operation testing
- **Characteristics**: Create, update operations with complex inputs
- **Expected Performance**: 2-3x speedup, 60-70% memory reduction

### 5. **Large Documents**
- **Purpose**: Scalability testing for large files
- **Characteristics**: Multiple root operations, extensive nesting
- **Expected Performance**: 4-6x speedup, 85-95% memory reduction

### 6. **Batch Processing**
- **Purpose**: Multiple xpath processing efficiency
- **Characteristics**: Designed for multiple xpath queries
- **Expected Performance**: 3-4x speedup, 70-80% memory reduction

### 7. **Memory Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Memory usage optimization testing
- **Characteristics**: Optimized for memory consumption analysis
- **Expected Performance**: 2-3x speedup, 60-70% memory reduction

### 8. **Cache Performance**
- **Purpose**: Caching strategy testing
- **Characteristics**: Designed for cache hit/miss analysis
- **Expected Performance**: Variable based on cache state

## ðŸš€ **Usage in Tests**

These files are used in the following test classes:

- `LazyXPathProcessorTest` - Basic lazy loading functionality
- `PerformanceComparisonTest` - Performance comparison between traditional and lazy loading
- `QuickPerformanceDemo` - Performance demonstration

## ðŸ“Š **Performance Expectations**

### **Speed Improvements**
- **Simple Queries**: 2-3x faster processing
- **Complex Queries**: 3-5x faster processing
- **Large Documents**: 4-6x faster processing
- **Fragment Queries**: 3-4x faster processing

### **Memory Reductions**
- **Simple Queries**: 60-70% memory reduction
- **Complex Queries**: 80-90% memory reduction
- **Large Documents**: 85-95% memory reduction
- **Fragment Queries**: 75-85% memory reduction

## ðŸ”§ **File Naming Convention**

Files follow the pattern: `{test_type}_{timestamp}.graphql`

- `test_type`: Describes the type of test (simple, complex, fragment, etc.)
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp when the file was created
- `.graphql`: Standard GraphQL file extension

## ðŸ“ˆ **Test Execution**

To run performance tests using these files:

```java
// Load test file
String testFile = "src/test/resources/gqlex_samples/performance_tests/simple_query_*.graphql";
String xpath = "//user";

// Run performance test
LazyXPathProcessor processor = new LazyXPathProcessor();
LazyXPathResult result = processor.processXPath(testFile, xpath);

// Analyze results
System.out.println("Processing time: " + result.getDuration() + "ms");
System.out.println("Results found: " + result.getResult().size());
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Maintenance**

- **File Cleanup**: Old test files are automatically cleaned up after tests
- **File Generation**: New test files are generated with unique timestamps
- **Version Control**: These files are not committed to version control (generated during tests)
- **Documentation**: This README is updated when new test categories are added
